I am awfully sorry to bother you again about the £15 you owe us from your share in the cost of redecorating the club. I have not heard from you since I wrote you about this three weeks ago.
	As you know, the club was involved in a lot of expense over this scheme. Indeed, we wouldn’t have gone ahead with it if members hadn’t agreed to contribute to meet the expense. 
	Since I am the club’s treasurer, the accountant is now urging me to get the money in; our bank manager has also asked me to clear the short-term overdraft they have allowed us. I do hope you let us have the check soon. 
	With kind regards,
