	I am sorry to have to trouble you again about the Â£15 you owe us for your share in the cost of redecorating the club. I have not yet received your reply to my last letter dated 14 June.
	As you know, the club has incurred a great deal of expense in connection with this scheme. Indeed, we would not have proceeded with the matter had not members agreed to contribute and signed undertakings to this effect.
	The club accountant is now urging me in my capacity as treasurer, to collect all the contributions; I am also under pressure from our bank manager to clear the short-term overdraft they have permitted us. 
	I hope you will be good enough to send us your check at your earliest convenience.
